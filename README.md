# Time Until Date
A web app written for Firebase using basic HTML

This is a web application intended to allow users to point to the URL with a time option to set a timer that will be recognized regardless of the user's locale and timezone. When opened, it will show the amount of time that has elapsed or is remaining until the date given. Dates and time calculation are done using the [Moment.js library](https://momentjs.com/).
